> Comments: The responsiveness where your top 10s go into carousels is amazing. I loved that part as well as seeing the tucked reviews and trailers inside of buttons to bring up. Everything works great and functions well. I was also hoping to see maybe some information on why you guys love those games and movies the most! Other than that you guys killed this project. Great job overall!
